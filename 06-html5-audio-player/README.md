# HTML5 Audio Player Prototype

Before HTML5, audio files could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash)
The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page. 
The audio element also allows you to specify multiple sources, so a browser that can' t play one type of file can fall back to another type.In HTML5 there are 3 supported audio formats: MP3, WAV and Ogg
Not all browser support these audio file format eg firefox and Opere supports all file formats.
