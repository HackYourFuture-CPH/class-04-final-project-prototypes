# Reactive Search Prototype

## Introduction

We'll use a search engine called Elasticsearch to serve the data
and ReactiveSearch is one of the tools that are used to create frontend search fields using React

## Purpose

We need a tool to query elasticsearch and provided out of the box search components like (TextSearch, category dropDown & Dates, ..)

Research existing frontend solutions out there to query elasticsearch from the frontend

Understand why we need such tool and the features that could benefit us to make a powerfull and user friendly search experience

Also a quick overview over elasticsearch and how it saves data would prove useful

## Questions

* What is Elasticsearch?
* What is ReactiveSearch?
* Are there any better alternatives other than ReactiveSearch?
* How to connect to an existing Elasticsearch engine from ReactiveSearch?
* Is the whole solution (Elasticsearch & ReactiveSearch) good to create a search page?

## Exercise

* Research basics of Elasticsearch (how it saves data and in what structure)
* Find a tutorial or a demo (ReactiveSearch provides few of them) to test the library
* Try to write custom elasticsearch queries (simple ones would be enough for now)
* Try to check the network tab in chrome dev tools to inspect the network requests from existing demos from ReactiveSearch (and try to understand them)

## Target

* You know what Elasticsearch is and how is saves data
* You can write basic queries to query Elasticsearch
* You know how to use ReactiveSearch and tried it with a demo
* You know the data flow and how the search works
