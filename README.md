 The project is about setting up a mock API-JSONSERVER which mimicks a backend so you can concentrate on your app.

+install npm package
+You need to create a package.json
+First you need to install jsonserver
+provide a data file like db.json
+run the code from terminal by $npm jsonserver
+Use Ajax to fetch data from the server

Challenges:
The data use is a bit messy and the format it was provided was a bit confusing
