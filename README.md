# Class04 Final Project Prototypes
The purpose of this repository is to provide a place for the research for the class04 final project.

We identified the following topics for research:
1. [Storybook](/01-storybook)
2. [Knex JS](/02-knex-js)
3. [Mongo DB](/03-mongo-db)
4. [JSON Server](/04-json-server)
5. [Reactive Search](/05-reactive-search)
6. [HTML5 Audio Player](/06-html5-audio-player)

When you contribute your research remember to fill out the Readme.md file in each subfolder with your findings along with the files needed to get a prototype of the technology running.

When you write your documentation in the readme file here are some things you may consider including:
* How to run your prototype
* What did you learn from building the prototype?
* What was the process? Did you try out some things that did not work and that other students should try to avoid as well?
* Any links to good resources that may benefit in understanding the technology. Could be from the official documentation or maybe tutorials.
* We will try to post a couple of questions in each readme before you start that you should try to answer.
