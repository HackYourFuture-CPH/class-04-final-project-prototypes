# Storybook Prototype

Purpose: Figure out whether it is feasible to use [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) for the Final Project.

Questions:
* What does Storybook do?
* Why do we need it?
* How do you set up Storybook within a project?

Exercise:
1. Create a React project in this folder and hook the project up with Storybook.
2. Create a simple component to select the genre of music (dropdown select) and create a couple of different stories where the component gets loaded with different selections of music styles available to choose.
3. Create a component that represent a single song including metadata as if it was part of a long list of songs. Make two stories so you can display that song with either a light or a dark background.
4. Create another component that uses the previous component to create a list of songs. Again make story for presenting the list with a light background and another for presenting it with a dark background.
